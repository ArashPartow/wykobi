#### Description
Wykobi is an efficient, robust and simple to use multi-platform 2D/3D
computational geometry library. Wykobi provides a concise,
predictable, and deterministic interface for geometric primitives and
complex geometric routines implemented in C++.

The design and structure of Wykobi lends itself to easy and seamless
integration into projects of any scale that require a robust yet
efficient 2D/3D computational geometry back-end.
